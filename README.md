# My Very First Web Page

Welcome!

## Project aim:

This project aims to showcase some of the main technologies that I shall be using,
on the Code-Institute full stack web developer course.

## Technologies;

1. Git
2. GitHub
3. HTML5
4. CSS3
5. JavaScript
6. Cloud9
7. Python
8. Flask
9. MongoDB
10. MySQL
11. DJango
12. Heroku

## *Project Rationale*

The rationale of this project was to use git and github along with
my previous knowledge from the course to consolidate some of my learning
of HTML5 and CSS3. Whilst also learning how to start putting them all together to create professional projects of my own without as much guidance.
